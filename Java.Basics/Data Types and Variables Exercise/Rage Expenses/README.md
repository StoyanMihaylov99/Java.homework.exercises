Rage Expenses:

As a MOBA challenger player, Peter has the bad habit of trashing his PC when he loses a game and rage quits. His gaming setup consists of a headset, mouse, keyboard, and display. You will receive Peter's lost games count.

Every second lost game, Peter trashes his headset.

Every third lost game, Peter trashes his mouse.

When Peter trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard.

Every second time when he trashes his keyboard, he also trashes his display.
