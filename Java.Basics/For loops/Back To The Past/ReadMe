Back To The Past:



Ivancho is 18 years old and receives an inheritance that consists of X amount of money and a time machine. He decides to go back to 1800 years, but he doesn't know if the money will be enough to live without working. Write a program that calculates whether Ivancho will have enough money so that he does not have to work up to and including a given. Assuming that for each even year (1800, 1802, etc.) he will spend BGN 12,000. For each odd number (1801,1803, etc.) he will spend 12,000 + 50 * [the years he reached in the given year].



Input:


The input is read from the console and contains exactly 2 lines:
• Inherited money – real number in the interval [1.00 ... 1 000 000.00]
• The year to live up to (inclusive) – an integer in the interval [1801 ... 1900]


Output:


To print to the console 1 line. The amount must be formatted to two decimal places:
• If the money is enough:
o "Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left." – where N is the money he will have left.
• If the money is NOT enough:
o "He will need {M} dollars to survive." – where M is the amount that does NOT reach.
