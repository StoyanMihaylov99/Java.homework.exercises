Left and right sum:


Write a program that reads 2 * nth integers provided by the user and checks that the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). In case of equality, print "Yes, sum =" + the amount; otherwise print "No, diff =" + the difference. The difference is a value as a positive number (absolutely absolute).
