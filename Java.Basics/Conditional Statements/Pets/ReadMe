Pets:


Marina likes to travel. She has 3 pets (dog, cat and turtle). When he goes on a trip, he has to consider how much food to leave for them so that they don't go hungry. Write a program that calculates how many kilograms of food everyone will eat during the time Marina is away and whether the food left by her will be enough for them. Each animal eats a certain amount of food per day.



Input:


Five lines are read from the console:
• First line – number of days – integer in interval [1…5000]
• Second line – food left in kilograms – integer in interval [0…100000]
• Third line – food per day for the dog in kilograms – real number in interval [0.00…100.00]
• Fourth line – food per day for the cat in kilograms – real number in interval [0.00…100.00]
• Fifth line – food per day for the turtle in grams – real number in interval [0.00…10000.00]



Output:


On the console it should be printed on one line:
• If the food left IS sufficient:
o "{kilogram left} kilos of food left."
? The result must be rounded to the lower integer
• If the food left is NOT enough:
o “{kilograms are missing} more kilos of food are needed.”
? The result must be rounded to the higher integer




Example:                 Output:

2                        3 kilos of food left.
