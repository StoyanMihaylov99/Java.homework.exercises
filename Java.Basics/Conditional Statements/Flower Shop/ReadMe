Flower Shop:



Maria wants to buy her son a present. She works in a flower shop. An order for flowers comes into the shop. Write a program that calculates the amount of the order and whether the profit is enough for the gift. Flowers have the following prices:
 
• Magnolias – BGN 3.25
• Hyacinths – 4 BGN
• Roses – BGN 3.50
• Cacti – 8 BGN
From the total amount, Maria has to pay 5% taxes.



Input:


The input is read from the console and consists of 5 lines:
• Number of magnolias – an integer in the interval [0 … 50]
• Number of hyacinths – an integer in the interval [0 … 50]
• Number of roses – an integer in the interval [0 … 50]
• Number of cacti – an integer in the interval [0 … 50]
• Price of the gift – a real number in the interval [0.00 … 500.00]


Output:


One line should be printed to the console.
• If the money HAS arrived: "She is left with {remaining} leva." – the amount must be rounded to a smaller whole number (eg 1.90 -> 1).
• If the money is NOT enough: "She will have to borrow {remaining} leva." – the amount must be rounded to a larger whole number (eg 1.10 -> 2).
