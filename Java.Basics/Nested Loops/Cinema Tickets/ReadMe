Cinema Tickets:


Your task is to write a program that calculates the ticket percentages for each type of ticket sold: student, standard, and kid, for all screenings. You should also calculate what percentage of the hall is filled for each screening.


Input:

The input is a sequence of integers and text:

· On the first line until receiving the command "Finish" - movie name - text

· In the second row – the free seats in the salon for each screening – an integer [1 … 100]

· For each film, one line is read until the empty seats in the hall are exhausted or until the "End" command is received:

o Purchased ticket type - text ("student", "standard", "kid")





Output:

The following lines should be printed to the console:

· After each film is printed, what percentage of the theater is full

"{movie name} - {percent occupancy of the theater}% full."

· On receiving the command "Finish" to print four lines:

o "Total tickets: {the total number of tickets purchased for all movies}"

o "{percent of student tickets}% student tickets."

o "{percentage of standard tickets}% standard tickets."

o "{percentage of kids tickets}% kids tickets."
