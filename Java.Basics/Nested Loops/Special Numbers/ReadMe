Special number:


To write the program that reads a single integer N entered by the user and produces all possible "special" numbers from 1111 to 9999. For a number to be "special" it must satisfy the following condition:

· N is divisible by each of its digits without a remainder.

Example: for N = 16, 2418 is a special number:

· 16 / 2 = 8 with no remainder

· 16 / 4 = 4 with no remainder

· 16 / 1 = 16 with no remainder

· 16 / 8 = 2 with no remainder



Input:

The input is read from the console and consists of a single integer in the range [1…600000]



Output:

All "special" numbers separated by a space should be printed on the console


Example:

Input:                      Output:
 
3                      1111 1113 1131 1133 1311 1313 1331 1333 
                       3111 3113 3131 3133 3311 3313 3331 3333
