Traveling:


Annie loves to travel and wants to visit several different destinations this year. Once you have chosen a destination, you will estimate how much money she will need to get there and start saving. When she has saved enough, she will be able to travel.

The console will read each time the first destination and the minimum budget that will be needed for the trip, a real number.

Then several sums will be read, real numbers, that Annie saves by working and when she has saved enough for the trip, she will leave, and the console should read:

"I'm going to {destination}!"

When it has visited all the destinations it is looking for, instead of destination you will enter "End" and the program will end.
