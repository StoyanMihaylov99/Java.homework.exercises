Exam Preparation:



Write a program in which Marin solves exam problems until she receives an "Enough" message from her lecturer. For each solved task he gets a grade. The program should finish reading the data on the command "Enough" or if Marin receives the specified number of dissatisfied ratings. Any score less than or equal to 4 is unsatisfactory.


Input:

· On the first line - number of unsatisfactory ratings - an integer in the interval [1...5]

· After that, two lines are repeatedly read:

o Task name - text

o Score - an integer in the range [2…6]


Output:

· If Marin reaches the "Enough" command, print on 3 lines:

o "Average score: {average score}"

o "Number of problems: {number of all problems}"

o "Last problem: {last problem name}"

· If he receives the specified number of unsatisfactory marks:

o "You need a break, {number of unsatisfactory grades} poor grades."

Average grade to be formatted to the second decimal place.
