Vacation:

Jessie has decided to raise money for a field trip and she wants your help to find out if you will be able to raise the necessary amount. She specializes or spends some of her money every day. If she wants to spend more than her available money, she will spend all of it and will have BGN 0 left.


Input:


The console reads:

· Money needed for the excursion - a real number in the interval [1.00…25000.00]

· Available money - real number in the interval [0.00...25000.00]

Then they are repeatedly read in two lines:

· Type of action - text with "spend" and "save" options

· Amount to save/spend - real number in the range [0.01…25000.00]


Output:

The program must be terminated in the following cases:

· If for 5 consecutive days Jesse only spends, the console should read:

o "You can't save the money."

o "{Total Days Elapsed}"

· If Jesse collects the money for the vacation, the console displays:

o "You saved the money for {total number of days passed} days."
