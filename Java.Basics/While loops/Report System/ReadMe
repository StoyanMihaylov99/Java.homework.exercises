Report System:



In the case of a beneficial event, the payments for the purchased products always alternate: cash payment and card payment. The rules for payment are established: the following
• If the product exceeds BGN 100, it cannot be paid for in cash
• If the product is priced below BGN 10, it cannot be paid for by credit card
The program turns on either after we receive the "End" command or after the funds are collected.


Input:


The console reads:
• Amount expected to be collected from sales - integer in the range [1 ... 10000]
On each subsequent line, until the "End" command is received or until the necessary funds are collected: the prices of the items to be purchased - an integer in the interval [1 ... 500]



Output:


On the console to print:
• On successful transaction: "Product sold!"
• In case of a failed transaction: "Error in transaction!"
• If the sum of all purchased products exceeds or reaches the expected sum, the program should terminate and two lines should be written to the console:
o "Average CS: {average payout in cash per person}"
o "Average CC: {average card payment per person}"
              Payments must be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.
• When receiving an "End" command, to write one line:
o "Failed to collect required money for charity."
