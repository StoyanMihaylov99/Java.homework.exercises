Walking:


Gabby wants to start a healthy lifestyle and has set a goal of walking 10,000 steps every day. Some days, however, she is very tired from work and you will want to prepare before you reach your goal. Write the program that reads from the console how many steps it takes each time it goes out during the day and when you reach your goal it says "Goal reached! Good job!" and how many more steps did "{difference between steps} steps over the goal!" walk.

If you want her to go home before then, she will enter the command "Going home" and enter the steps she walked on the way home. After which, if she failed to reach her goal, the console should read: "{difference between steps} more steps to reach goal."



Example:


Input:            Output:


1500                 2500 more steps to reach goal.
