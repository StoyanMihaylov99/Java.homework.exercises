Palindrome Integers:


A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program that reads a positive integer number until you receive "END". For each numbered print whether the number is palindrome or not.


Example:


Input:          Output:

123              false
323              true
421              false
121              true
