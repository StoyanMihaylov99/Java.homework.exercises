Change lists:


Write a program that reads a list of integers from the console and receives commands which manipulate the list. Your program may receive the following commands:

· Delete {element} - delete all elements in the array which are equal to the given element

· Insert {element} {position} - insert element at the given position

You should stop the program when you receive the command "end". Print all numbers in the array, separated with a single whitespace.




Example:


Input:


1 2 3 4 5 5 5 6

Delete 5

Insert 10 1

Delete 5

end


Output:


1 10 2 3 4 6
