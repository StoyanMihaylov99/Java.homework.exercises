Sum Adjacent Equal Numbers:



Write a program to sum all adjacent equal numbers in a list of decimal numbers, starting from left to right.

§ After two numbers are summed, the obtained result could be equal to some of its neighbors and should be summed as well (see the examples below).

§ Always sum the leftmost two equal neighbors (if several couples of equal neighbors are available).




Example:


Input:             Output:

3 3 6 1             12 1
