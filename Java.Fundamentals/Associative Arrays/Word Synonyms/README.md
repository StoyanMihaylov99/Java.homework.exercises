Word Synonyms

Write a program that keeps a map with synonyms. The key to the map will be the word. The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word. You will be given a number n. On the next 2 * n lines, you will be given the word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:

If you get the same word for the second time, just add the new synonym to the list.
