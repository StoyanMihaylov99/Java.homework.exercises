A miner task:


Until you receive the "stop" command, you will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line. Every odd line on the console represents a resource (e.g., Gold, Silver, Copper, etc.) and every even - quantity. Your task is to collect the resources and print them on a new line.

Print the resources and their quantities in format: "{resource} –> {quantity}".

The quantities inputs will be in the range [1 … 2 000 000 000].




Example:



Input:

155

Silver

10

Copper

17

Output:



Gold -> 155 
Silver -> 10 
Copper -> 17
