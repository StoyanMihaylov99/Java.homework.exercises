Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
You are free to choose how the data is entered. Each entry should have just one name and one number (both of them strings). If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, simply update its number.
After filling this simple phonebook, upon receiving the command "search", your program should be able to perform a search of contact by name and print her details in the format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist.".





Input:


John-0888080808
search
Maria
John
stop




Output:


Contact Maria does not exist.
John -> 0888080808
