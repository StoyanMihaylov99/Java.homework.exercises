Write a program that prints information about food shops in Sofia and the products they store. Until the "Revision" command you will receive an input in the format: "{shop}, {product}, {price}".

Keep in mind that if you get a store that already exists, you must gather product information.

Your output must be ordered by shop name and must be in the format:

"{shop}->

Product: {product}, Price: {price}"

The price should be formatted to one digit after the decimal point.





Example:



Input:


lidl, peach, 1.20

lidl, juice, 2.30

fantastico, apple, 1.20

kaufland, banana, 1.10

fantastico, grape, 2.20

Revision





Output:



fantastico-> 
Product: apple, Price: 1.2 
Product: grape, Price: 2.2 
kaufland-> 
Product: banana, Price: 1.1 
lidl-> 
Product: peach, Price: 1.2 
Product: juice, Price: 2.3
