Rework the previous problem so that a child is removed only on a composite (not prime) cycle (cycles start from 1). 
If a cycle is prime, just print the child's name.
As before, print the name of the child that is left last.



Example:


Input:


Maria Peter George
2



Output:


Removed Peter
Prime Maria
Prime George
Removed Maria
Last is George
