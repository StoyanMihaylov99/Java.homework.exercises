You are given a sequence of text lines. Assume these text lines form a matrix of characters (pad the missing positions with spaces to build a rectangular matrix). Write a program to rotate the matrix by 90, 180, 270, 360,… degrees. Print the result as a sequence of strings at the console after receiving the "END" command.




Example:


Input:

Output:

xoe 
afl 
mtl 
 uo 
 n 
 i
