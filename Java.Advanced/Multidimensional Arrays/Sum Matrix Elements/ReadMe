Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:

· The count of rows

· The count of columns

· The sum of all matrix's elements

On the first line, you will get the matrix dimensions in the format "{rows, columns}". On the next lines, you will get the elements for each row separated by a comma.



Example:



Input:


3, 6

7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1

1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6

4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0



Output:


3
6
76
