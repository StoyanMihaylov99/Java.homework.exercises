Write a program that reads an integer N on the first line. And on next N lines read pairs of "{name}, {age}". Then read three more lines:
·	Condition - "younger" or "older"
·	Age - Integer
·	Format - "name", "age" or "name age"
Depending on the condition, print the pairs in the right format.
Don't use any built-in functionality. Write your methods.

Peter, 20
George, 18
Maria, 29
Idan, 31
Simeon, 16
