Train The Trainers:



The "Train the trainers" course is coming to an end and the final evaluation is approaching. Your task is to help the jury that will evaluate the presentations by writing a program that calculates the average grade from the presentation of each presentation by a given student, and finally the average success of all of them.

The number of people in the jury is read from the console of the first row n - an integer in the interval [1…20]

After that, the name of the presentation - text - is read on a separate line

For each presentation on a new line, read n - the number of ratings - a real number in the interval [2.00…6.00]

After calculating the average score for a particular presentation, it is printed to the console

"{presentation name} - {average grade}."
After receiving a "Finish" command, the console prints "Student's final assessment is {average of all presentations}." and the program ends.

All values ??must be formatted to the second decimal place.
