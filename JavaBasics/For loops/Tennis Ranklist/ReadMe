Tennis ranklist:


Grigor Dimitrov is a tennis player, the next goal is to climb the world rankings in men's tennis.

Over the years, Grisho has participated in a number of tournaments, earning points for each tournament that depend on the position he has finished in the tournament. There are three options for ending the tournament:

- W - if the winner receives 2000 points

- F - if a finalist receives 1200 points

- SF - if he is a semifinalist he gets 720 points

Write a program that calculates how many points Grigor will have after playing all the tournaments, knowing how many points the season starts with. Also calculate how many points he averages from all the tournaments played and what percentage of the tournaments he has won.


Input:



Two lines are read from the console first:


· Number of tournaments in which he participated - an integer in the interval [1… 20]

· Initial number of points in the ranking list - an integer in the interval [1 ... 4000]


A separate line is read for each tournament:

· Reached stage of the tournament - text - "W", "F" or "SF"



Output:



Three lines are printed in the following format:

· "Final points: {number of points after the tournaments played}"

· "Average points: {average points earned per tournament}"

· "{Percentage of tournaments won}%"

The middle points should be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and the percentage should be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.



Example:



Input:                  Output:


                       Final points: 8040 
                       Average points: 1328 
                       40.00%
