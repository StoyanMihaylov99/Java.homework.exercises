Half sum element:



Write a program that reads the n-th number of integers entered by the user and checks if there is a number among them that is equal to the sum of all the others.

· If there is such an element, print "Yes" and on a new line
 "Sum =" + its value

· If there is no such element, print "No" and on a new line
 "Diff =" + the difference between the largest element and the sum of the others (in absolute value).




Example:
