Dishwaser:


Gosho works in a restaurant and is responsible for loading the dishwasher at the end of the day.
Your task is to write a program that calculates if a given quantity of dishwasher detergent bottles purchased is sufficient to pick the specified quantity of dishes. Each bottle is known to contain 750 ml. detergent, 5 ml is needed for 1 plate, and 15 ml for a pot. Assume that every third time the dishes are loaded, the dishwasher is filled only with pots, and the rest of the times with plates. Until you get the command "End" you will continue to get the number of dishes to be discarded.


Input:
 
 • Number of bottles of detergent that will be used for washing dishes - an integer in the interval [1…10]
On each subsequent line, until receiving the command "End" or until the amount of detergent is exhausted, number of dishes to be washed - an integer in the interval [1…100]



Output:


In the event that the amount of detergent was sufficient to wash the dishes:
"Detergent was enough!"
"{number of clean plates} dishes and {number of clean pots} pots were washed."
"Leftover detergent ml."
In case the amount of detergent was not enough to wash the dishes:
"Not enough detergent, {amount of detergent not reached} ml. more necessary!"






Example:


Input:       Output:

2             Detergent was enough!
53            118 dishes and 55 pots were washed.
65            Leftover detergent 85 ml.
