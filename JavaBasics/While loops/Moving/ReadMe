Moving:



On his eighteenth birthday, Jose decided that he was going to move out and live in a boarding house. He packed his luggage in boxes and found a suitable ad for an apartment for rent. He begins to carry his luggage in parts because he cannot carry it all at once. He has limited free space in his new home where he can arrange things so that the place is livable.


Write a program that calculates the free volume of Jose's apartment that remains after he has moved his luggage.

Note: One carton is exact dimensions: 1m. x 1m. x 1m.


Input:

The user enters the following data on separate lines:

1. Width of free space - an integer in the interval [1...1000]

2. Length of free space - an integer in the interval [1...1000]

3. Height of free space - an integer in the interval [1...1000]

4. On the next lines (until the "Done" command is received) - number of boxes that are transferred to the accommodation - an integer in the interval [1...10000]

The program should finish reading data on a "Done" command or if free space runs out.


Output:

Print one of the following lines to the console:

· If you get to the "Done" command and there is still free space:

"{number of free cubic meters} Cubic meters left."

· If free space runs out before a "Done" command is received:

"No more free space! You need {number of missing cubic meters} Cubic meters more."



Example:


Input:             Output:
 

10                 No more free space! 
                   You need 2 Cubic meters more.
