COins:


Vending machine manufacturers wanted their machines to return as little change as possible. Write a program that accepts an amount - the change to be returned and calculates how few coins this can be done.



Example:



Input:           Output:                 

1.23                 4




Comment:

he change is not 1 BGN and 23 cents. The machine returns it to us with 4 coins: a 1-lev coin, a 20-cent coin, a 2-cent coin and a 1-cent coin.
