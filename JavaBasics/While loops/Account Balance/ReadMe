Acount Balance:


Write a program that calculates how much total money is in the account after you make a certain number of deposits. On each line you will receive the amount you need to deposit into the account until you receive a "NoMoreMoney" command. For each amount received, "Increase: " + the amount must be displayed on the console and added to the account. If you get a number less than 0 the console should display "Invalid operation!" and the program to end. When the program ends, it should print "Total: " + the total amount in the account formatted to the second decimal place.


Example:


Input:             Output:

5.51                Increase: 5.51 

69.42               Increase: 69.42 

100                 Increase: 100.00 

NoMoreMoney         Total: 174.9
