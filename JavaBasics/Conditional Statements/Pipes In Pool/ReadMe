Pipes in pool:

A pool of volume V has two pipes from which it is filled. Each pipe has a certain flow rate (liters of water passing through one pipe in one hour). The worker starts the pipes simultaneously and leaves in N hours. Write a program that retrieves the results from the pool the moment the worker returns.



Input:


Four lines are read from the console:
• The first line contains the number V - Pool volume in liters - an integer in the range [1…10000].
• The second line contains the number P1 - flow rate of the first pipe per hour - an integer in the interval [1…5000].
• The third line contains the number P2 – flow rate of the second pipe per hour – an integer in the interval [1…5000].
• The fourth line contains the number H - the hours the worker is absent - a real number in the interval [1.0...24.00]



Output:


To print to the console one of two possible states:
• How much did the pool fill and which pipe contributed what percentage.
o "The pool is {pool full in percent}% full. Pipe 1: {percent water from the first pipe}%. Pipe 2: {percent water from the second pipe}%."
If the pool has overflowed - how many liters have overflowed in the given time.
o "For {the hours that the pipes filled with water} hours the pool overflows with {liters of water in excess} liters."



Example:

Input:         Output:

1000           The pool is 66.00% full. Pipe 1: 45.45%. Pipe 2: 54.55%.
