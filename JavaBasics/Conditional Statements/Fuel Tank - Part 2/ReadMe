Flue tank - Part 2:


Write a program to calculate how much it will cost a driver to fill up the tank of his car, given the type of fuel he fills, the price per liter of fuel, and whether he has a discount card. Fuel prices are as follows:

• Gasoline – BGN 2.22 per liter,
• Diesel – BGN 2.33 per liter
• Gas – BGN 0.93 per liter


If the driver has a discount card, he benefits from the following reductions per liter of fuel: 18 cents per liter of petrol, 12 cents per liter of diesel and 8 cents per liter of gas.
If the driver has loaded between 20 and 25 liters inclusive, he gets an 8 percent discount on the final price, for more than 25 liters of fuel, he gets a 10 percent discount on the final price.
