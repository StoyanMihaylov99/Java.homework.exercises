Match Tickets:


When the Euro 2016 tickets were released, a group of fans decided to buy them. Tickets have two categories with different prices:
• IP – BGN 499.99.
• Normal – BGN 249.99.
Zapalyankovites have a certain budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget should be set aside for transpoFrom 1 to 4 - 75% of the budget.

• From 5 to 9 – 60% of the budget.
• From 10 to 24 – 50% of the budget.
• From 25 to 49 – 40% of the budget.
• 50 or more – 25% of the budget.

Write a program that calculates whether they can buy tickets for the selected category with the remaining money from the budget. And how much money will they have left or need.



Input:

The input is read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:
• On the first line is the budget - a real number in the interval [1 000.00 ... 1 000 000.00]
• On the second line is the category - "VIP" or "Normal"
• On the third line is the number of people in the group - an integer in the interval [1 ... 200]



Output:

To print one line to the console:
• If the budget is sufficient:
o "Yes! You have {the rest of the group's money} leva left."
• If the budget IS NOT sufficient:
o "Not enough money! You need {amount that does not reach} leva."
Amounts must be formatted to two decimal places.
