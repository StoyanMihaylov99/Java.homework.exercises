From a vineyard with an area of ??X square meters, 40% of the harvest is set aside for wine production. Y kilograms of grapes are obtained from 1 square meter of vineyard. 2.5 kg are needed for 1 liter of wine. grapes. The desired quantity of wine to be sold is Z liters.
Write a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether this amount is sufficient. If there is enough, the remainder is divided equally among the vineyard workers.




Input:


The input is read from the console and consists of exactly 4 lines:
• 1st row: X sq.m is the vineyard - an integer in the interval [10 … 5000]
• 2nd row: Y grapes for one square meter – real number in the interval [0.00 … 10.00]
• 3rd line: Z required liters of wine – an integer in the interval [10 … 600]
• 4th row: number of workers – an integer in the range [1 … 20]




Output:


The following should be printed on the console:
• If the wine produced is less than required:
o “It will be a tough winter! More {insufficient wine} liters wine needed.”
? The result must be rounded to a lower integer
• If the wine produced is as much or more than required:
o “Good harvest this year! Total wine: {total wine} liters.”
? The result must be rounded to a lower integer
o “{Remaining wine} liters left -> {wine for 1 worker} liters per person.”
? Both results must be rounded to the higher integer




Example:


 
Input:                  Output:

                  Good harvest this year! Total wine: 208 liters.
                    33 liters left -> 11 liters per person.
